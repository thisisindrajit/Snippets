# Snippets

In our rapidly changing digital age, the way we absorb information is shifting dramatically. Traditional learning methods often can't keep pace with the needs of today's learners, who crave quick, digestible content.Many young people find themselves spending hours on social media, often interacting with content that offers little to no educational value.

I personally wanted to address this challenge, and so I created Snippets ‚Äî a heartfelt, open-source and innovative ed-tech social media platform. Snippets harnesses the power of artificial intelligence to offer engaging, bite-sized learning experiences that are as enjoyable as they are educational. With its AI-generated snippets structured in the 5W1H framework, Snippets makes learning not just accessible, but a delightful journey of discovery.

### ‚ùì What is the problem that Snippets is trying to address?

- **Social Media Addiction:** Many young people are spending significant amounts of time on social media platforms, often engaging with content that lacks educational value.

- **Lack of Valuable Information:** The prevalent content on social media is often misleading or highly superficial, not contributing to personal growth or knowledge acquisition.

- **Reduced Critical Thinking:** Constant exposure to non-educational content can lead to a decline in critical thinking and analytical skills.

- **Knowledge Gap:** There's a growing gap in accessible, quality educational content that is both engaging and informative on social media platforms.

### üí° Why was I motivated to create Snippets

I was inspired to create Snippets because I saw how countless young people, including those close to me and even myself at times, were spending hours on social media without gaining anything meaningful. It saddened me to see potential being wasted on content that neither educates nor enriches lives. I wanted to create a space where people could turn their screen time into a valuable learning experience, where knowledge and growth were just a scroll away. Snippets is my way of offering a meaningful alternative‚Äîa place where engaging, bite-sized educational content can empower users to expand their minds and discover new passions. This platform is my hope for a brighter, more informed future for all who use it.
